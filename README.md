## fortunes
==================

Contains some fortune files and a script that will email or print your fortunes.

Install the ```.dat``` file to ```/usr/share/games/fortunes/``` or there about.

==================

### fortunes included

#### Firefly

The firefly fortune is included as I have found a few typos at times and fixed them here.

Originally from http://www.daughtersoftiresias.org/progs/firefly/

#### Community

Here's one for Community. Please fork and add to the community fortunes file. I have added as much as I can and ordered them by Season and episode. There may be duplicates.

As near as I can google, this is the first such fortune repo for NBC's Community TV show.

Pop! Pop!
